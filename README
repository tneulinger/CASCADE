CASCADE detector simulation

Simulates passage of 5.48MeV alpha particles through Ar(85)/CO2(15) balance
gas and generate histogram of energy deposited.

Status: 14/04/2020
Would need to really figure out what physics is applicable here for this
simulation to be meaningful. At the moment the physics is probably wrong.


# TO BUILD AND RUN:

# 1. change to build directory
cd build

# 2. cmake
cmake ../
# this requires that $G4INSTALL = /your/geant4/install/directory
# otherwise add this flag
cmake -DGeat4_DIR=/your/geant4/install/directory ../

# 3. make
make

# 4. run the application
# 4a. run in batch mode
./CASCADE run.mac
# or
./CASCADE run.mac > run.out
# 4a. run in interactive mode
./CASCADE
# then at terminal
/control/execute run.mac
